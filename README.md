Q : quit<br>
R : record
M : mute

## Version 0.0.1
[24.07.17]<br>
Library and threading usage has been changed.<br>
Convenience features such as background recording, circle size adjustment, and coordinate logging have been added.

1. <b>Improved screenshot capture speed</b> : Replaced pyautogui.screenshot() with mss.grab().
2. <b>Constant optimization</b> : Frequently used values have been designated as constants.
3. <b>Computation optimization</b> : Utilized NumPy array operations. 
4. <b>Threading improvement</b> : Sound playback function now runs directly in a thread & notifications only sound when the state changes (switching inside/outside the circle). 
5. <b>Default settings</b> : Set default values for 'Window/Radius' to the OBS window and 45. 
6. <b>Background recording feature</b> : Background screen recording is now possible. 
7. <b>Real-time circle size adjustment</b> : Adjust the circle size in real-time using the '+' and '-' keys while the program is running.
8. <b>Coordinate logging</b> : Records time and coordinate positions.
